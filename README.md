# my_sway_config
My Sway tile window manager configuration.

## Dependencies 

Actually I'm using everything that comes by default on sway, at least on ArchLinux. dunst, grim, etc...

But there is some extras:

bluetui
pulsemixer
rofi
nwg_look
qtct6
thunar
sfetch (It is my own fetcher, search in my repos)
oh-my-zsh

## How to use this customization?

To use this config copy everything to your /home or use install script.

```
chmod +xr ./install && ./install
```
